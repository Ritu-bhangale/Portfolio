      <h3>The Problem</h3>
      <p>
        The challenge facing individuals who frequently relocate, such as
        bachelors, paying guests, and working professionals, is the high cost
        and uncertainty of staying in a place, which discourages them from
        buying furniture, electronics, and appliances. These individuals require
        furniture for relatively short periods of time, but are unable to find
        affordable and convenient rental options.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="solution">
      <h3>The Solution</h3>
      <p>
        Flent provides a platform that allows individuals to rent furniture,
        electronics, and appliances for whatever period they require, whether it
        be a week, a month, or a year. Flent aims to make the rental process
        easy and accessible, while also promoting sustainability through the
        provision of refurbished and recycled items. The problem that Flent aims
        to solve is the lack of affordable and convenient rental options for
        individuals in need of furniture, electronics, and appliances for short
        periods of time.

        <h3>Qualitative Research</h3>
        <p>
          I conducted individual interviews with 7-8 users to understand their
          furniture purchasing behaviors and decision-making processes.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The objective of the qualitative research was to gain a deeper
          understanding of the users problems and needs when it comes to
          purchasing furniture, electronics, and appliances. The interviews were
          structured to cover the following areas:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Furniture purchasing behaviors</li>
          <li>Considerations when purchasing furniture</li>
          <li>Challenges faced during the purchasing process</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I used open-ended questions to encourage the participants to share
          their experiences and opinions in detail.

        <p>
          I conducted an online survey to collect data from a larger group of

          random questions based on the participants' willingness to answer.
        </p>
        <p>
          The objective of the quantitative research was to gather data on
          users' online renting thinking, their habits and preferences when it
          comes to purchasing furniture, electronics, and appliances. The survey
          covered the following areas:

                Prateek is a driven individual with a passion for
                problem-solving and exploring new experiences. As a student at
                the Indian Institute of Information Technology, Nagpur, he is
                constantly seeking new challenges to take on and grow his skill
                set. Living as a paying guest in Nagpur city, Prateek has faced
                the difficulty of bringing furniture from his native place and
                has realized the need for a more budget-friendly solution. While
                searching for furniture rental services, he came across a few
                apps but was disappointed to find that the monthly charges were
                too high for his budget. This led him to seek a platform that
                offers good quality furniture at an affordable cost, with
                excellent service. Prateek's needs and experiences serve as an
                inspiration for creating a better solution in the furniture
                rental market.
